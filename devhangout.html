   <h4>Here you find the Developer's ideas for new thing to add to the site, tips, tricks, info, and more!</h4>
   <p>I will soon add some puzzles and maybe even hide the VIP password at the end, if you have been to the secret page.</p>
    <p>I also might add a unsuspicious page so that you can hide the website.</p>
