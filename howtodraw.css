    <p>This page will teach you how to draw many thing that people find hard to draw. Let's g<a class="secret3" href= "secret%20page%203.html">o</a>! </p>
    <h3>Hair</h3>
    <p>Lots of people don't like drawing hair because they think that it takes too much time and it doesn't look realistic enough. But trying harder and practicing will make it better.</p>
    <ol> <li>Try to draw the hair in the same direction. It doesn't have to take very long to look good, if you want to do it quickly, it will still work.</li> <li>Don't try to make your person's hair "picture perfect"- Sometimes putting a couple strands of hair that looks different and flying away will make it look even more natural.</li> <li>Use different shades! Pressing hard with your pencil and sometimes lighter in some spots will give the sense that sunlight is hitting the hair. </li></ol>
    <h3>Hands</h3>
    <p>The reason people think that hands are hard to draw is because that when they do it, the fingers look misshapen and the palms either look too big or small.</p>
    <ol> <li>Practice by looking at your own hand and copying it. Maybe tracing it will work too! This is because your brain has something to copy and the next time you draw a hand, it will be much easier.</li> <li>If the hand looks weird, don't worry! Just erase it and try again. Usually making the fingers thinner or fatter will do the trick.</li></ol>
    <h3>The Face</h3>
    <p>Faces are probably one of the hardest body parts to draw. Common mistakes are making the eyes too large, or making the nose too high.</p>
      <ol> <li>Try putting a cross on the face. The eyes should be in the middle, but it doesn't seem like it because of the hair.</li> <li>If you fail, <i>erase and try again!</i> Chances are that you've heard this saying like a hundred times, but mistakes do help you learn.</li> <li>The mouth may also be too large. Remember that the lower lip should be larger than the upper lip.</li> </ol>
    <h3> Shadows</h3>
    <p>The reason why shadows are disliked is mostly because they look unnatural sometimes. With practice, though, they can ad lots of style to a drawing!</p>
    <ol><li>Imagine a light hitting a side of the object. If it is hitting the right side, the shadow should be drawn to the left of the object.</li><li>Make the shadow lighter than the object and spread it with your finger. This will give the shadow a smooth effect.</li><li>Decide houw dark the shadow will be by the amount of light the room has.</li>
    <p> I hope that these tips will help you on your drawing journey!</p>
