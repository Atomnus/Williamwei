<p>This website, William's Workshop, was first a seventh grade school computers project but then evolved into a complicated web of secrets. It was made be me and some friends. Sorry, it's not <i>that</i> good, i'm not very experienced at coding. You can find it at atomnus.github.io/Workshop. FYI, this is mostly made for kids still in school. That doesn't mean adults can't do it, though! Try to find everything, and good luck! P.S. There is a lot more to the website at the end of the... well, you'll find out. Don't give up! Feel free to email me with any questions or concerns at littlewilliamwei@gmail.com.
