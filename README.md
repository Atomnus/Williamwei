#William's Workshop
<h2>README</h2>
<p>This website was first a school computers project but then evolved into a complicated web of secrets. FYI, this is mostly made for kids still in school. Try to find everything, and good luck! P.S. There is a lot more to the website at the end. Don't give up! Feel free to email me with any questions at littlewilliamwei@gmail.com. -Will</p>
