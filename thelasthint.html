<h2>The Last Hint</h2>
<p>You have done well. If you followed my directions in the last hint, you will be thinking where the next part of the password is. All I can tell you is that it is on this page. I am constantly surprised by your efforts to find this secret, which to tell the truth, isn't that hard to find after all. It was easy.</p>
<p>You're probably looking at me skeptically, "What is wrong with this guy? I looked for this and it took a long time!", but you'll see.</p>
<p>The password page was under your nose the whole time. You could've found it in the first secret page. "No that's not possible! This guy is crazy!" Nope. Go back, highlight the whole page.</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p class=password>You're so smart. Well, you earned it, I should tell you the last part of the password. It is 463.</p>
