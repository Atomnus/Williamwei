<h2>The Last Hint</h2>
<p>You have done well. I am constantly surprised by your efforts to find this secret, which to tell the truth, isn't that hard to find after all. It was easy.</p>
<p>You're probably looking at me skeptically, "What is wrong with this guy I looked for this and it took a long time", but you'll see.</p>
<p>The password page was under your nose the whole time. You could've found it in the first secret page. "No that's not possible this guy is crazy" Nope. Go back, highlight the whole page.</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
