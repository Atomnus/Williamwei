    <h2>The History of Atoms</h2>
    <p>The ancient Greeks had ideas about particles and atoms. But it wasn't until the beginning of the nineteenth century that a theory of atoms became linked to experimental evidence. It was at this time that an English scientist called John Dalton put forward his ideas about atoms. From his experiments and observations, he suggested that atoms were like tiny, hard balls. Each chemical element had its own atoms that differed from others in mass. Dalton believed that atoms were the fundamental building blocks of nature and could not be split. In chemical reactions, the atoms would rearrange themselves and combine with other atoms in new way. At the end of the nineteenth century, a scientist called J.J. Thomson discovered the electron. Thomson did experiments on the beams of particles in his tube. They were attracted to a positive charge, so Thomson correctly concluded that they must be negatively charged themselves. Other experiments showed that it would take about 2000 electrons to weigh the same as the lightest atom, hydrogen. He called the tiny, negatively charged particles electrons. But where had these tiny particles come from? Since they were so small, Thomson suggested that they could only have come from inside atoms. So Dalton's idea of the indestructible atom had to be revised. By 1920, physicists knew that most of the mass of the atom was located in a nucleus at its center, and that this central core contained protons. In May 1932 James Chadwick announced that the core also contained a new uncharged particle, which he called the neutron.
