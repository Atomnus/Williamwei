    <h2>The History of Atoms</h2>
    <p>The ancient Greeks had ideas about particles and atoms. But it wasn't until the beginning of the nineteenth century that a theory of atoms became linked to experimental evidence. It was at this time that an English scientist called John Dalton put forward his ideas about atoms. From his experiments and observations, he suggested that atoms were like tiny, hard balls. Each chemical element had its own atoms that differed from others in mass. Dalton believed that atoms were the fundamental building blocks of nature and could not be split. In chemical reactions, the atoms would rearrange themselves and combine with other atoms in new ways.
