    <p>Welcome to the last secret page. Good job! This page was the hardest to find.</p>
    <p>But, this is not the page you are looking for.</p>
    <p>This was a trick.</p>
    <p> The real page is in another place. Also, yes, I never wanted you to find the secret. I didn't expect you to get this far. The <i>real</i> secret is somewhere in this website, though. Somewhere like... a note? Yes, a note. Good thing you don't know how to inspect or view the source code. Do you? Eh, whatever.</p>
    <p>But don't go looking for it. It's not like you'll listen anyway, so i'll warn you: i've put it under tons of security. Now shoo!</p>
