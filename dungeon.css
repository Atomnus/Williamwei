Good job. You found it. The password is 920463. Now for the hint. I will place the hint for the password site in the next page. The answer of this riddle will take you to the page. The first letter of the answer is the link. Only one color, but not one size. Stuck at the bottom, yet I easily fly. Present in sun, but not in rain. Doing no harm, and feeling no pain. What Am I?
