  <h2>How Atoms Work</h2>

  <a href=historya.html>History of Atoms</a>
  <p>Most atoms have three different subatomic particles inside them: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are packed together into the center of the atom, which is called the nucleus. Also, the electrons, which are much, much smaller than the other particles, whizz around the outside. What makes an atom of gold different from an atom of iron is the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons inside it. Cut apart a single atom of iron and you will find 26 protons and 30 neutrons clumped together in the nucleus and 26 electrons whizzing around the outside. An atom of gold is bigger and heavier. Split it open and you'll find 79 protons and 118 neutrons in the nucleus and 79 electrons spinning round the edge. The protons, neutrons, and electrons in the atoms of iron and gold are identical—there are just different numbers of them. In theory, you could turn iron into gold by taking iron atoms and adding 53 protons, 88 neutrons, and 53 electrons to each one. But it just isn't as easy as it sounds! Atoms are a bit like people: they usually prefer company to being alone. A lot of atoms prefer to join up with other atoms because they're more stable that way. So hydrogen atoms don't exist by themselves: instead, they pair up to make what is called one molecule of hydrogen. A molecule is the smallest amount of a compound: a substance made from at least two atoms.</p>
  <h3>What are Protons?</h3>
  <p>Protons are a stable subatomic particle occurring in the nucleus of every atom. It has a positive electric charge equal in magnitude to that of an electron, but has an opposite sign (p or p+). One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom, as they are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Each element has a unique number of protons, so each element has its own unique atomic number. Until recently, the proton was considered a fundamental particle. However, new technology has led to the discovery that the proton is actually composed of smaller particles called quarks. A quark is a fundamental particle of matter that only recently has been discovered. There are six known types of quarks; up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom. A proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark.</p>
  <h3>What about Neutrons?</h3>
  <p>Neutrons are a stable subatomic particle occurring in the nucleus of every atom (same with protons), with a positive electric charge equal in magnitude to that of an electron, but of opposite sign. They have a mass that is slightly larger than protons. These neutrons are present in all atomic nuclei except those of ordinary hydrogen. When a large star explodes, blowing off its outer layers in a brilliant fireball called a supernova, the remaining matter is incredibly dense, and it collapses under its own gravitation.  When this stellar remnant acquires a certain critical density, basically all of the subatomic particles become neutrons.  The resulting object is a neutron star that might have a diameter smaller than that of the earth, yet have a mass hundreds of times that of the sun. If a bullet as dense as a neutron star were to be dropped into Earth, it would tunnel down into the ground until it rests in the Earth's core.</p>
  <h3>What are Electrons?</h3>
  <p>Electrons are a stable subatomic particle with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids. Together, all of the electrons of an atom create a negative charge that balances the positive charge of the protons in the atomic nucleus. Electrons are extremely small compared to all of the other parts of the atom. The charge on a single electron is considered as the unit electrical charge. Electrical charge quantity is not usually measured in terms of the charge on a single electron, because this is an super small charge. Instead, the standard unit of electrical charge quantity is the coulomb, symbolized by C, representing about 6.24 x 1018 electrons.</p>
