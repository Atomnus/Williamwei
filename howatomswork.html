  <a href=historya.html>History of Atoms</a>
  <p>Most atoms have three different subatomic particles inside them: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are packed together into the center of the atom (which is called the nucleus) and the electrons, which are much, much smaller, whizz around the outside.
  <h3>What are Protons?</h3>
  <p>Protons are a stable subatomic particle occurring in the nucleus of every atom. It has a positive electric charge equal in magnitude to that of an electron, but has an opposite sign (p or p+). One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom, as they are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Each element has a unique number of protons, so each element has its own unique atomic number</p>
  <h3>What about Neutrons?</h3>
  <p>Neutrons are a stable subatomic particle occurring in the nucleus of every atom (same with protons), with a positive electric charge equal in magnitude to that of an electron, but of opposite sign. They have a mass that is slightly larger than protons.</p>
  <h3>What are Electrons?</h3>
  <p>Electrons are a stable subatomic particle with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids.</p>
