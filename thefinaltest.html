    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the final test. If you can prove that you are worthy, then you will get the password for the secret in the secret page. Then, you will have to find the page (which is pretty hard to find). Hey, don't whine, you aren't supposed to be here anyway! Click on the link below to enter the dungeon. The password will be located somewhere in the source code. If you are on a tablet or phone, I guess this is the end for you. I have made the source code especially hard, and if you do not know how to view the source code, then sorry, this is also the end for you. Please go with caution, I don't want a little kid to ruin my site for me. Good luck! </p>
