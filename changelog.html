    <p>I have no idea of how you stumbled upon this secret. Maybe you just saw that the "unfinished" looked suspicious. Maybe you saw that this has been unfinished for a long time and you wanted to see what was going on. Whatever the reason, good job! I never thought someone whould be able to find a secret like this.</p>
    <p>So what am I going to do with this page? This is probably going to become a changelog. If you don't know what that is, search it up. There aren't many changes yet, but look out! Soon there will be more. Unlike any of my other secrets, I am OK with letting you share this with any friends.</p>
    <p>Keep checking for any changes! I will remove the message above and start the actual changelog sometime next week.</p>
